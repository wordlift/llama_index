    "# Structured Planning Agent\n",
    "\n",
    "A key pattern in agents is the ability to plan. ReAct for example, uses a structured approach to decompose an input into a set of function calls and thoughts, in order to reason about a final response.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, breaking down the initial input/task into several sub-tasks can make the ReAct loop (or other reasoning loops) easier to execute.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `StructuredPlanningAgnet` in LlamaIndex wraps any agent worker (ReAct, Function Calling, Chain-of-Abstraction, etc.) and decomposes an initial input into several sub-tasks. Each sub-task is represented by an input, expected outcome, and any dependendant sub-tasks that should be completed first.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook walks through both the high-level and low-level usage of this agent.\n",
    "\n",
    "**NOTE:** This agent leverages both structured outputs and agentic reasoning. Because of this, we would recommend a capable LLM (OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.), and open-source LLMs may struggle to plan without prompt engineering or fine-tuning."
