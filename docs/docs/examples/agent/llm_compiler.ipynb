As of 2010, 34.4% of city residents were of Cuban origin, and other significant populations included Central American, South American, and West Indian or Afro-Caribbean American origins. The non-Hispanic white population has been growing in the 21st century, making up 14.0% of the population by 2020. The city also has a small Asian population, accounting for 1.0% of the population in 2010. Christianity is the most practiced religion in Miami, followed by Judaism, Islam, Buddhism, Hinduism, and other religions.

      "\u001b[0m\u001b[1;3;34mRan task: vector_tool_Seattle. Observation: During wintertime, Seattle experiences cool, wet weather. Extreme cold temperatures, below about 15 °F or -9 °C, are rare due to the moderating influence of the adjacent Puget Sound, the greater Pacific Ocean, and Lake Washington. The city is often cloudy due to frequent storms and lows moving in from the Pacific Ocean, and it has many \"rain days\". However, the precipitation is often a light drizzle rather than heavy rainfall.\n",
      "\u001b[0m\u001b[1;3;34mRan task: vector_tool_Chicago. Observation: During wintertime, the city experiences relatively cold and snowy conditions. Blizzards can occur, as they did in winter 2011. The normal winter high from December through March is about 36 °F (2 °C). January and February are the coldest months. A polar vortex in January 2019 nearly broke the city's cold record of −27 °F (−33 °C), which was set on January 20, 1985. Measurable snowfall can continue through the first or second week of April. The city's proximity to Lake Michigan tends to keep the lakefront somewhat cooler in summer and less brutally cold in winter than inland parts of the city and suburbs away from the lake. Northeast winds from wintertime cyclones departing south of the region sometimes bring the city lake-effect snow.\n",
